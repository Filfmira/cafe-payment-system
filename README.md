Cafe Payment System
===================

This project consisted of developing a system where users can place orders to a cafeteria, choosing items from the menu and the quantities, and transmit them possibly with vouchers to a terminal inside the cafeteria establishment. After this process, the customer only needs to wait and collect the order placed, when ready.

For this purpose, we developed an Android application that serves both as a customer app or a terminal app, depending on the users' access level. For the database and server-side code we used both Firebase and our own custom Node.js server hosted on Heroku.
